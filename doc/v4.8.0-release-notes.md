# MT 4.8.0 Release notes

Hope you read that [massive changelog](https://github.com/E66666666/GTAVManualTransmission/blob/master/doc/changelog.md#480)!
Here's a few things to pay attention to
when updating from 4.7.x. Also check the 4.7.0 release notes if you're updating
from 4.6.x or earlier.

## Animations

The script now overrides the animations and matches the steering wheel
rotation. The system needs a bit of help to understand what to do, though.

Let me know if anything is missing, so I can update `animations.yml` to support
as many vehicle types as possible out-of-the-box.

`animations.yml` is a text file containing the animation definitions: What
animations to use for which vehicle layouts, and how many degrees of rotation
chosen the animation supports. *Most* game vehicles are present already, but
most add-ons need to be added.

If a vehicle doesn't have matching animations, do this:

1. Open the `vehicles.meta` containing your car.
2. Find the `<layout>` for your car entry.
3. Copy the contents of that (for example, `LAYOUT_STD_AE86`).
4. Paste it in `animations.yml` in a suitable animation.

You can usually guess what's suitable from the other entries already present.
The debug menu has an animation section where you can force animations, you
can also use that to find a suitable animation.

If a vehicle defines an animation clipset *not* in `animations.yml`, it can
be added.

1. Check the layout name in `vehicles.meta`.
2. Check the corresponding clipset dictionaries in `vehiclelayouts.meta`
3. Check the corresponding clipset dictionaries in `clip_sets.xml`
4. Make an educated guess what the dictionary is for your vehicle
5. Check the dictionary in `clip_anim.rpf`
6. Open the `.ycd` in notepad and hope you find a `steer_no_lean` or `pov_steer`
7. Copy an `- Animation:` entry in `animations.yml` - **mind the indentation!**
8. Substutite the dictionary and animation name for your vehicle, replace
layouts with your new layout and throw in an educated guess what the rotation
degree is.

Useful resource:
[AlexGuirre's animation list](https://alexguirre.github.io/animations-list/).

If the current steering angle is more than what the animation supports, it will
just stay at the maximum.

## Camera

When animations are active, it clamps the camera rotation in FPV to about
15 degrees. I added a first person vehicle camera which allows for more freedom.

The player head is hidden and nearer clipping is enabled when you install
[CamxxCore](https://www.gta5-mods.com/users/CamxxCore)s' `DismembermentASI.asi`.

Manual Transmission redistributes that asi, but it can also be grabbed from
jedijosh's [Dismemberment](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/dismemberment)
script.

A new feature is movement following - the camera can look at where you're
going to be, rotation included. This feature is optimized for smooth movement
input, like a wheel, controller or mouse. You can turn it down or off,
if it nauseates you.

Both mouse and controller look are supported, and there are a
bunch of things to customize.

Alternatively, check out these camera scripts!

* [Custom Camera V Plus](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/custom-camera-v-plus)
* [Better Vehicle First Person](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/better-vehicle-first-person)
* [Drive Modes](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/drive-modes)

They're not compatible, but you can turn off my camera and they should work
without conflicts.

## Dashboard

The script can now toggle dashboard lights. Currently it flashes the ABS light
if ABS action is detected, and turns on a bunch of warning lights when stalled.

candy.
